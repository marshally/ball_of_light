## Calibration

```bash
ball_of_light calibrate
```

The Ball of Light supports two different calibration routines: Point Calibration
and Auto Calibration. Using Point Calibration, we can label

Recommended floor points to calibrate: front (closest to the Kinect), back
(farthest from the Kinect), left, right, and bottom (direct center of the
floor).

This will begin the `ball_of_light` test sequence. There are 9 or more calibration points per light, so this will take between 15m and 1h for 12 lights. Depending on how quickly you move.
