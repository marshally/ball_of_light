# If a second person enters the field
# Change bottom lights to red
# Change all other lights to green
# Increase the speed of the heartbeat pulse.
# Continue Kinect body detection routine as above, but when first body points to
# a light, turn it blue and when second body points, turn it white. This
# acknowledges that the second person is welcome, and that the first one has
# already had a chance to play.
# If the number of persons drops back to two, go back to the one person routine.
