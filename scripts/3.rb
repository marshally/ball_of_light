# If a third or fourth person enters the field
# Time to give up, because thatâ€™s enough programming! Besides, we are running
# out of lights.
# With the top and equatorial lights pointed more-or-less down toward the base
# square, begin a slow square spiral routine, cycling randomly through all the
# gobos and colors.
# The bottom lights can do a fast narrow spiral, with the center still pointed
# straight up, completing one spiral forwards and backwards in about a second or
# less. Cycle through the colors with a round spot.
# Continue until the number of persons drops below four.
